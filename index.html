                            <p class="card-text">My name is Brian. I've just graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Most of my work has been in Scala and Python, though I can easily adapt to other languages and paradigms.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Notably, I was an undergraduate programming mentor for Computer Science I and Principles of Software at RPI, and I was one of four coordinators at the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS).</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I'm in the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Class of 2017. I've learned a ton about Data Structures, Algorithms, Programming Languages, Discrete Mathematics, Operating Systems, Database Systems, and Computer Organization, Cryptography, Graph Theory, and more.</p>

                        <p>I have worked as a part of the Rensselaer Center for Open Source for all four years of my time at RPI. During this, I've tried a lot of new things as well as done my best to have a positive impact. As such, I have gained some of the more "soft skills" many CS majors don't learn. This would be skills like speaking, to both large and small groups, as well as documentation, management, and mentorship.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" style="margin-top: 0px;">Worked with the Security Intelligence team on an ETL pipeline designed to detect potential threats to the network. Used Scala, AWS Lambda, and AWS Kinesis to process massive amounts of data in near real time.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In RCOS, I provide assistance to projects including those I take a special interest in. There are a lot of procedures associated with being a successful project in the club, and over the past two years I've become familiar with all of them</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of my Senior year, I became a coordinator for RCOS. This is the highest ranking position in the club, where I managed the day-to-day workings of the club. This consisted of keeping track of the over 100 members of the club, dealing with any issues that came up, partnering with the Open Source Initiative and Mozilla, while also performing member and mentor responsibilities.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">As an undergraduate mentor for Computer Science I, I tutor students taking the class to help them understand all the concepts introduced in the class. Besides just simple ideas such as Boolean logic, functions, and some basic data structures, I also helped explain more abstract ideas such as Object Oriented thinking and recursion.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">As an RA, I manage one of the Residence Halls on campus. I've been trained on conflict mediation, stress relief, and dealing with mental health issues. I have also become proficient at dealing with awkward situations.</p>
