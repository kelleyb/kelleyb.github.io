                <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Brian Kelley. I'm a recent graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, currently working at Amazon. I work in Information Security, currently on the Security Intelligence team. We build a system to ensure the security of internal and customer data.</p>
                <p>I'm an advocate of functional programming, and I inject components of that style into all of my projects, regardless of what language I happen to be using. The language I'm most proficient in is Scala, followed closely by Python. I also have experience in Java, C, C++, and others. Finally, I have a good amount of experience with Amazon Web Services, especially with serverless architecture.</p>
                <p>When it comes to what I like working on, I love back end development. Building highly scalable systems that power important platforms is what keeps me going, despite the fact that the vast majority of people will never see what I do.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I'm a professional pizza snob, hobbyist pizza baker, and a hockey fan who watches way too many games. I've also taken up playing hockey, though I'm not very good yet. You can expect me to begin my entry level NHL contract in the next couple of years though, so watch out for me there.</p>

                <p>As an SDE in the Security Intelligence Detection team, I own a system which aids security engineers in keeping Amazon safe from threats.</p>
                <p>We use Scala to build scalable, fault tolerant systems.</p>

                <p>As an intern with the Security Intelligence Data Platform team, I was tasked with prototyping an ETL system utilizing serverless technologies, and comparing that with the existing platform. As a result of my findings, the team could save a large amount of money each year.</p>

                <p>Worked with the Strategic Risk Programme developing unit tests and UI functionality for development of a custom Model Driven Development system. The system allowed engineers to communicate and define an idea while also creating resources to be used in the resulting solution</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>

                <p>I graduated with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Class of 2017, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>Subject matter studied includes Database Systems, Graph Theory, Cryptography, Operating Systems, as well as others.</p>
                <p>I held several leadership positions at school, such as undergraduate programming mentor for Computer Science I and Principles of Software, Resident Assistant for two years, and mentor/coordinator for the Rensselaer Center for Open Source</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">RCOS</h2>

                <p>During my time at Rensselaer, I became heavily involved with the <a href="https://rcos.io" title="Rensselaer Center for Open Source">Rensselaer Center for Open Source</a> (RCOS). RCOS is a community which gives budding developers a platform to learn new technologies and work on projects they're interested in, without the fear that the project not being successful will result in a failing grade, or an empty wallet. It also introduces students to the world of open source.</p>
                <p>The club enables students to practice development skills, as well as soft skills such as giving presentations and writing documentation.</p>
                <p>I became a coordinator in my Senior year, which means I facilitated day to day operations of the club. This included managing the 100+ members, organizing small and large group meetings, communicating with the mentors about their groups and mentees, and organizing external talks.</p>
