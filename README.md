PersonalSite
============

This is my personal website! As of right now, it serves as a basic "about me" page which can be accessed by recruiters (or anyone else who may want to). I also kind of just do whatever I want to it.

For example: I've implemented a very straightforward version of cowsay into my site. Just enter the command:

    cowsay "Hello World!"

To get a cow saying hi. You can also enter

    cowsay -f calvin "Hello World!"

to get Calvin doing the same thing. As far as I can tell, I've added in all the cows in the regular application (at least on my system).


Another example of something I added in: Tab completion. I've gotten used to being able to complete my commands in Linux using the tab key. So why not add it into my website? With any supported command, just start typing it and press tab. If there is only 1 match for what you've typed, the input will be replaced with the correct command. This also works when chaining commands together with "&&". Which is another thing I've added.
